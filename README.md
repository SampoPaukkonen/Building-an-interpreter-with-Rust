# Building-an-interpreter-with-Rust
This repository encompasses my attempt to both learn how to build an interpreter, and more importantly, how to build one in Rust.
The book [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Bob Nynstrom serves as my guide and mentor. Any credits of interpreters/compilers/language
creating in this project will go to Bob Nynstrom; subsequently any blame can be send to me.
